Ruofeng Tang, Jin Ning Huang  
This project has four tasks. Task 1 and 3 are in Task1_3.py, task 2 is in Task2A.py and Task2B.py, task 4 is in Task4.py and Task4_line_Plots_Only.py.  
Task 1 and 3's test is in Task1_3_test.py, task 4's test is in Task4_test.py, task 2 does not have tests. See "Note" part at the end.  
All task files include paths to read files. The paths only include the uploaded folder.  
The datasets can all be downloaded from Seattle.gov website:  
https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5 The downloaded file contains a dash. Should be replaced by an underscore.

Jin Ning's NOTE: 
- (everything on py file) we ran our code locally so change to the appropriate file path in order to run on your computer. 
- (Task 2 folder) for some odd reason, my computer doesn't recognize the dataset file path anymore. 
All the python scripts for Task 2 was running fine and no errors; however, just yesterday
and today (as on August 17 and 18), the script wasn't recognizing the file path anymore, 
and there wasn't a slight change in my code scripts nor I had moved the dataset around. So, 
therefore, I was unable to make a test case for Task 2 unfortunately.I was using the latest 
version of Sypder with Python 3.7. 
- (Task 1 and 3 folder) One of Ruofeng dataset would be missing here ('SPD_Crime_Data__2008_Present.csv') 
since his dataset contains about 174 mb. Which is strange since Jin's version of that 
SPD data can mangae to upload it here.
